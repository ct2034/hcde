@misc{EvolutionOpenSource,
 abstract = {The most recent episode of Command Line Heroes is all about the process of contributing to open source, from the point of view of a contributor and a maintainer. It's a great episode - don't just take my word for it, you can listen here - but you can only tackle so much in one episode! One thing that the episode sparked for me is just how much the nature of open source contribution has changed since Netscape first took the plunge with Mozilla in 1998.In the past 20 years, we've seen a strong shift away from a culture of hobbyist developers tinkering with projects as they find time, to folks doing open source contribution as part of their day job. Whether that's folks paid to work on open source full time, or people who contribute to open source as part of their day job because the project is relevant to their other work.As open source has become more of a mainstay of just about every business, more businesses started hiring developers to ensure the success of those projects. Or they turned to companies (like, yes, Red Hat) that could support their use of open source by maintaining, improving, and even creating new projects to address business needs.At this point, I'd wager that the vast majority of open source contributions are coming from professionals of one stripe or another, rather than hobbyists. That's not to say that people have stopped working on open source in their spare time, or that open source is unsuitable for hobby projects. But the trope of open source as a communal, volunteer-driven activity is outdated.Recognizing contributions of all formsNotice how I shifted from "developers" to "contribution" earlier when talking about the shift from hobbyists to professionals? That's not an accident -- in the late 90s, projects rarely recognized the importance of non-developer contributions. Projects, like Debian or the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), that had formal roles with voting power usually wrote their criteria around code contributions of some kind. If your "only" contribution was documentation, good luck being recognized and voted into a position of influence in a project.Today, I'm happy to say, that is much less common. Many projects, like the ASF, Debian, and Fedora have worked to acknowledge contributors who bring a wide range of skills needed to maintain a healthy open source project.And, again, many of these folks are doing this as part of their day job. Support for open source projects as a whole - not merely the code - is understood as important to the business.Better community management and governanceJust as projects and communities have learned that producing open source requires many skill sets beyond developing code, they're learning that contributing to a project and governing it is a skill in and of itself. In fact, our understanding of and approach to developing open source has led to the production of entire books that codify best practices for open source development.Working in the open requires confidence and trust. It's one thing to send your work to a couple of peers you know well and have a relationship with, it's quite another to send work to an open list where anyone can critique it and a person well outside your workplace has the final say of whether it's accepted or not.Being a good contributor takes practice. It requires learning how the project operates, perhaps a different set of tools than you're used to - git vs. SVN, or a new bugtracker, or new Kanban tool - as well as receptiveness to feedback and willingness to adapt.Even more difficult is being a good maintainer. An effective maintainer strives to ensure that all contributors are treated equally, and treated well. Mentoring new contributors, and handling their contributions professionally - even if they're ultimately unused - is not unlike being a good manager.That's why I'm so pleased to have an episode of Command Line Heroes that addresses this topic head-on. Building our skills as contributors and maintainers is crucial to developing successful, sustainable, open source projects. Take a few minutes and listen to "Ready to Commit" today, or if you haven't started with Command Line Heroes yet, you can start at the beginning with episode one.},

@misc{groeneveldExploringRoleCreativity2021,
 abstract = {In order to solve today's complex problems in the world of software development, technical knowledge is no longer enough. Previous studies investigating and identifying non-technical skills of software engineers show that creative skills also play an important role in tackling difficult problems. However, creativity is typically a very vague concept to which everyone gives their own interpretation. Also, there is little research that focuses specifically on creativity in the field of software engineering. To better understand the role of creativity in this field, we conducted four focus groups, inviting 33 experts from four nationally and internationally renowned companies in total. This resulted in 399 minutes of transcripts, further coded into 39 sub-themes grouped into seven categories: technical knowledge, communication, constraints, critical thinking, curiosity, creative state of mind, and creative techniques. This study identifies the added value of creativity, which creative techniques are used, how creativity can be recognized, the reasons for being creative, and what environment is needed to facilitate creative work. Our ultimate goal is to use these findings to instill and further encourage the creative urge among undergraduate students in higher education.},

Specifically, the authors add the idea of ``mini-c,'' creativity inherent in the learning process, and Pro-c, the developmental and effortful progression beyond little-c that represents professional-level expertise in any creative area. The authors include different transitions and gradations of these four dimensions of creativity, and then discuss advantages and examples of the Four C Model.},

@book{nadiaeghbalWorkingPublicMaking2020,
 abstract = {An inside look at modern open source software development and its influence on our online social world. Open source software, in which developers publish code that anyone can use, has long served as a bellwether for other online behavior. In the late 1990s, it provided an optimistic model for public collaboration, but in the last 20 years it's shifted to solo operators who write and publish code that's consumed by millions. In Working in Public, Nadia Eghbal takes an inside look at modern open source software development, its evolution over the last two decades, and its ramifications for an internet reorienting itself around individual creators. Eghbal, who interviewed hundreds of developers while working to improve their experience at GitHub, argues that modern open source offers us a model through which to understand the challenges faced by online creators. She examines the trajectory of open source projects, including:The GitHub platform for hosting and developmentThe structures, roles, incentives, and relationships involved in open source projectsThe often-overlooked maintenance required of its creatorsThe costs of production that endure through an application's lifetime. Eghbal also scrutinizes the role of platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, YouTube, and Instagram, which reduce infrastructure and distribution costs for creators but which massively increase the scope of interactions with their audience. Open source communities are increasingly centered around the work of individual developers rather than teams. Similarly, if creators, rather than discrete communities, are going to become the epicenter of our online social systems, we need to better understand how they work---and we can do so by studying what happened to open source.},

@incollection{noonanIdentity2022,
 abstract = {Much of the debate about identity in recent decades has been aboutpersonal identity, and specifically about personal identity over time,but identity generally, and the identity of things of other kinds,have also attracted attention. Various interrelated problems have beenat the centre of discussion, but it is fair to say that recent workhas focussed particularly on the following areas: the notion of acriterion of identity; the correct analysis of identity over time,and, in particular, the disagreement between advocates of perduranceand advocates of endurance as analyses of identity over time; thenotion of identity across possible worlds and the question of itsrelevance to the correct analysis of de re modal discourse;the notion of contingent identity; the question of whether theidentity relation is, or is similar to, the composition relation; andthe notion of vague identity. A radical position, advocated by PeterGeach, is that these debates, as usually conducted, are void for lackof a subject matter: the notion of absolute identity theypresuppose has no application; there is only relativeidentity. Another increasingly popular view is the one advocated byDavid Lewis: although the debates make sense they cannot genuinely bedebates about identity, since there are no philosophical problemsabout identity. Identity is an utterly unproblematic notion. Whatthere are, are genuine problems which can be stated using the languageof identity. But since these can be restated without the language ofidentity they are not problems about identity. (For example, it is apuzzle, an aspect of the so-called ``problem of personalidentity'', whether the same person can have differentbodies at different times. But this is just the puzzle whethera person can have different bodies at different times. Sosince it can be stated without the language of personal``identity'', it is not a problem about personalidentity, but about personhood.) This article provides anoverview of the topics indicated above, some assessment of the debatesand suggestions for further reading.},

This revolutionary model for collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun Microsystems to IBM to Intel. The Cathedral \& the Bazaar is a must for anyone who cares about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come. According to Bob Young, "This is Eric Raymond's great contribution to the success of the open source revolution, to the adoption of Linux-based operating systems, and to the success of open source users and the companies that supply them." The interest in open source software development has grown enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded paperback edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and 2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing the benefits of open source software has been key to its success. With major vendors creating acceptance for open source within companies, independent vendors will become the open source story in 2001.},

The proposal amounts to a stronger version of Albert and Whetten (1985), in that the implicit links between the elements of their composite, tripartite, formulation are made explicit and their treatment of organizational identity as a defined construct is emphasized. Although the proposal eschews conceptions of organizational identity formulated from the perspective of individuals, it treats organizational identity as an analogue of individual identity, drawing attention to the parallel functions identity plays for both individual and collective social actors, as well as the parallel distinguishing structural features of individual and organizational identity referents. The principle recommendation is to conduct the study of member-agents' answers to the question, ``Who are we as an organization?'' within the parameters of a defined identity-claim conceptual domain (what) and associated phenomenological markers of identity-referencing discourse (how, when, why).},
