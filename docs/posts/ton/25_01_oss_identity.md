# How do Personal vs Company Identities affect Open Source Contributions?

Imagine that you are a maintainer of a widely used open source project relied upon by developers worldwide.
Now, there are two pull requests.
One from an individual contributor and one from a person that you know works for a certain company.
You know that the individual contributor has worked on the code they are contributing in their free time and you really like the quality of their pull request.
The other contribution is also of high quality.
Would you treat these contributions differently?
Should you?

Does it make a difference whether one person is working for a company and the other is not?<!-- more -->
Technically both of these are just persons contributing code.
But can you truly ignore the fact that one contributor belongs to a company, or do you even attribute their contribution primarily to that company?
A recent survey by the Linux Foundation found that organizations contribute 7.7B USD annually to open source projects and that 86% of that is contributed in the form of labor by individuals[@boysel2024OpenSource2024].
I am interested in the role that individual and company identities play in open source contributions.

To explore the topic, I will first provide background on Open Source Software and an overview of identity theory at both individual and collaborative levels.
Then I look at the nature of individual contributions in OSS, their motivations, and the role of community and meritocracy.
In contrast, I will explore how and why companies contribute to OSS and compare this to individual and community contributions.
Comparing both of the previous section I then identify key challenges and tensions.
Using the previously introduced organizational identity theory, I will propose resolutions to these tensions.
I then want to give some practical examples and strategies to handel these.
In the end I give a conclusion.

## Context: Open Source Software, Identity Theory

Open source in its basic form means that the source code of a piece of software is available freely for anyone to analyze, modify or share.
In practice, there are different licenses that are published with the source code each with somewhat different rights and duties associated to them.
But this is not what I am interested in, today.
What makes open source so powerful is that this free access to source code allows for truly open collaboration.
Eric S. Raymond described this in two contrasting models of software development of the "Bazaar" and the "Cathedral".
Here the Bazaar refers to the way software is developed in open source projects: openly and collaboratively, with many contributors.
While the Cathedral model symbolizes classic software development: closed within commercial development projects by a few experts.
And he argues that the Bazaar model is more effective for creating robust and innovative software[@raymondCathedralBazaarMusings2001].

For transparency reasons I want to declare that my analysis of these topics is influenced primarily by my personal experience in one open source project and that is ROS, the Robot Operating System.
It is an amazing framework for building robots, but it's technical details will not be of further relevance for this article.

Before exploring OSS projects further, though, I want to introduce the tool for this exploration: _identity_.
Generally speaking, identity is the relation an entity has to itself[@noonanIdentity2022].
Locke made clear that is fundamentally consciousness what allows for _personal identity_.
This consciousness can be extended backwards to past actions or thoughts[@lockeEssayConcerningHuman1694,@gordon-rothLockePersonalIdentity2020].
While this is a fundamental building block for identity, it alone will not help explaining what I am interested in.

A more modern take is _social identity_.
It is "a personâ€™s sense of who they are based on their  group membership(s)"[@turnerSocialComparisonGroup1979].
Knowing this can give people a sense of belonging, purpose, self-worth, and crucially identity.
In practice these groups can be defined by anything from ethnicity, religion to professional affiliation or musical preference[@turnerSocialComparisonGroup1979,@SocialIdentityTheory2023].
This can also explain aspects of how individuals identities are based on them being employed by a company.
However, I have one last section on corporations in particular.

When companies refer to themselves, it is called _organizational identity_.
Firstly, organizations are more than a collection of individual identities.
French argues that organizations as a whole have morality.
Basically, because they have intentionality and responsibility[@frenchCorporationMoralPerson1979].
When thinking about a company, then it is their capability to make decisions that leads to that intentionality.
A organization needs an identity to make these decisions.
And similarly to how we saw with Locke above, this is based on its own history but also by reference to a self-assigned organization type[@whettenAlbertWhettenRevisited2006].
I think, this is very interesting and can be used to explain many phenomena perceived when working in companies.
But for now, this is enough background and next I want to look at the nature of open source contributions in some more detail.

## Individual Contributions in OSS

Why do individuals contribute to open source?
I think, the core motivations are intrinsic.
The inherent passion for programming and development is not to be underestimated.
But, these OSS projects are also communities, and being involved in that can be very motivational.
And as we learned from social identity, belonging to a group is an ingredient to ones own identity[@SocialIdentityTheory2023].

Further, also extrinsic motivations play a role.
This includes ones own career advancement, because contribution to open source makes the individual visible and can create a reputation that may be useful when looking for a job.
But external recognition can also serve as a more general motivating factor.
Feeling seen as a valuable contributor increases ones self-worth.

I think this quote summarizes is well

> \[Motivations include\] both extrinsic, enhancing reputation and developing human capital and social networks; and intrinsic, satisfying psychological needs, pleasure, and a sense of social belonging.[@benklerCommonsBasedStrategiesProblems2004]

!!! note
    We could move all below here to "Organizational Identity Theory Applied to OSS"

While I talked over about recognition as one source of motivation, recognition does also serve a different purpose in open source projects: power.
Open source projects are often described as meritocracies.
Interestingly, was the term popularized by a dystopian book called _The rise of the meritocracy_ by Michael Young[@youngRiseMeritocracy1958].
In it, the envisioned future society based on meritocracy has many problems, maybe the biggest being a lack of social mobility.
But a careful analysis can disprove the negative effects of meritocracy that Young envisioned in 1958[@allenMichaelYoungsRise2011].
So today, meritocracy is generally considered a desirable political system.

Political systems look at how power is distributed.
And in meritocracy the idea is that power is awarded based on merit.
It is that merit that individual developers accumulate by contributing to open source projects.
With that, they will gain influence in the projects hierarchy.
This generally allows for more technically informed decisions, assuming that those that contributed to a project a lot also have a clear idea about it's inner workings.
There is an obvious contrast to how power is organized in companies, where decisions are generally those that are hierarchically entitles to make them but may not necessarily have the relevant technical insights.
This is not to say that in companies no technically informed decisions are made, but that the role and potential influence of individual engineers is different to that in open source projects.
In my opinion and experience, this is also a reason people contribute to open source projects.

Note that arguments can be made that hierarchical structures in the governance of many OSS projects may also bring them closer rigid structures of companies[@schrapeOpenSourceCommunities2018].
But this does not match my personal anecdotal evidence from my work in ROS and this may be different from project to project and the topic is generally of course not a precise binary difference.
But despite differences in the ways decisions are made, companies also have a lot of reasons engage in open source and this is what I want to look at next.

## Company Contributions to OSS

Why are companies interested in open source?
On a first analysis it may seem counterintuitive for a company that is generally interested in financial success to have in interest in improving software that must ultimately be and remain free to use and that is further shared with all of their direct competitors.
But it has been observed by many, that while historically it was individuals that primarily contributed to open source it is now companies[@raymondCathedralBazaarMusings2001,@schrapeOpenSourceCommunities2018,@EvolutionOpenSource].
Why is that?

A first motivation is _Quality_.
Eric S. Raymond introduced Linus's law as "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" which is named after Linus Torvalds[@raymondCathedralBazaarMusings2001].
And this certainly makes sense, that if more people look at a given code, the better it's quality will become, eventually.
But I would argue that this can also be attributed to how open source communities work.
Because as anyone having worked in big development projects knows, having too many engineers will note automatically emerge quality software.
However, I argue that it is also the organization of a diverse bunch of intrinsically motivated engineers in meritocratic structures that leads to the constant improvement of software quality.
But the promise of quality can not be the only motivations for companies investing that 7.7B USD annually in open source projects[@boysel2024OpenSource2024].

It gets really interesting to look at _Innovation_.
Historically it would be considered an inherent task of a company to create innovation themselves.
But the ever increasing advancement of the technical state of the art can make it challenging to keep up with that, let alone extending it through innovation.
OSS helps here by leveling the playing field.
When what is the state of the art is available for everyone to use it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel but individual companies can focus their development invest on what they think is innovative.
This is also what makes these projects hugely interesting for smaller companies, because the described effects are even more true for them.

If companies build their innovatability and therefore sometimes there whole business model on open source software, it is natural that they have an interest the wellfare the associated OSS project.
That is why many companies support such projects monetarily.
But this dependence also motivates the desire for influence.
Long-term strategic influence is often granted by the OSS project in return for the monetary support.
But for short-term technical influence it is often also in the interest of companies to actively contribute to the software by paying developers to do this.
This influence can also be more targeted but often requires building up contributors with the necessary influence long term[@ParticipatingOpenSource].

## Challenges and Tensions

At first sight, this seems like a mutually beneficial relationship: engineers want to contribute, companies let the do it and gain influence.
But this also bears challenges.
For example is it not easy for companies to know which influence they want or need in the long term.
And it can be very challenging for an engineer that sees the requirement for such influence to convince their employer to take the necessary investments.
Here it is interesting to think about to which identity this merit will then be linked.
That of the company or that of the individual engineer?
From my experience, it is often the individual up to a degree where these people take their merit with them when they change jobs.
This is obviously not in the interest of companies having invested in that specifically.
However through careful long-term OSS strategy work, it is also very much feasible for companies to accumulate merit and not loose it on personnel changes.

Another very real challenge for individual contributors and maintainers highlighted by Nadia Eghbal and others is that of burnout[@nadiaeghbalWorkingPublicMaking2020].
This phenomenon may well be inherent to insufficient governance in OSS project management.
Especially maintainers that fill positions that are very tailored to their person are in this risk.
Effective governance would define processes to distribute their workload to more people or find people to step in in case they need to take a break or attend personal duties.
It is also often simply unlikely to find someone else taking over that persons position.
Because, if they are doing a good job no one will contest their position and if their workload is perceived as basically more than a fulltime job, this get's even less likely.
The relation to company identities is weaker here: The described phenomenon usually applies to individuals where their identity is a lot more relevant to their success than the on of their company if that is even relevant at all.
However, it bears a tragic that many other companies are depending on that persons work without being able to ensure their proper working conditions.
