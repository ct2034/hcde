# How do Personal vs Company Identities affect Open Source Contributions?

Imagine that you are a maintainer of an important open source project.
Now, there are two pull requests.
One from an individual contributor and one from a person that you know works for a certain company.
You know that the individual contributor has worked on the code they are contributing in their free time and you really like the quality of their pull request.
The other contribution is also of high quality.

Does it make a difference whether one person is working for a company and the other is not?<!-- more -->
Technically both of these are just persons contributing code.
But can you truly ignore the fact that one contributor belongs to a company, or do you even attribute their contribution primarily to that company?
A recent survey by the Linux Foundation found that organizations contribute 7.7B USD annually to open source projects and that 86% of that is contributed in the form of labor by individuals[@boysel2024OpenSource2024].
I am interested in the role that individual and company identities play in open source contributions.

To explore the topic, I will first provide background on Open Source Software and an overview of identity theory at both individual and collaborative levels.
Then I look at the nature of individual contributions in OSS, their motivations, and the role of community and meritocracy.
In contrast, I will explore how and why companies contribute to OSS and compare this to individual and community contributions.
Comparing both of the previous section I then identify key challenges and tensions.
Using the previously introduced organizational identity theory, I will propose resolutions to these tensions.
I then want to give some practical examples and strategies to handel these.
In the end I give a conclusion.

## Context: Open Source Software, Identity Theory

Open source in its basic form means that the source code of a piece of software is available freely for anyone to analyze, modify or share.
In practice, there are different licenses that are published with the source code each with somewhat different rights and duties associated to them.
But this is not what I am interested in, today.
What makes open source so powerful is that this free access to source code allows for truly open collaboration.
Eric S. Raymond described this in two contrasting models of software development of the "Bazaar" and the "Cathedral".
Here the Bazaar refers to the way software is developed in open source projects: openly and collaboratively, with many contributors.
While the Cathedral model symbolizes classic software development: closed within commercial development projects by a few experts.
And he argues that the Bazaar model is more effective for creating robust and innovative software[@raymondCathedralBazaarMusings2001].

Before exploring OSS projects further, though, I want to introduce the tool for this exploration: _identity_.
Generally speaking, identity is the relation an entity has to itself[@noonanIdentity2022].
Locke made clear that is fundamentally consciousness what allows for _personal identity_.
This consciousness can be extended backwards to past actions or thoughts[@lockeEssayConcerningHuman1694,@gordon-rothLockePersonalIdentity2020].
While this is a fundamental building block for identity, it alone will not help explaining what I am interested in.

A more modern take is _social identity_.
It is "a personâ€™s sense of who they are based on their  group membership(s)"[@turnerSocialComparisonGroup1979].
Knowing this can give people a sense of belonging, purpose, self-worth, and crucially identity.
In practice these groups can be defined by anything from ethnicity, religion to professional affiliation or musical preference[@turnerSocialComparisonGroup1979,@SocialIdentityTheory2023].
This can also explain aspects of how individuals identities are based on them being employed by a company.
However, I have one last section on corporations in particular.

When companies refer to themselves, it is called _organizational identity_.
Firstly, organizations are more than a collection of individual identities.
French argues that organizations as a whole have morality.
Basically, because they have intentionality and responsibility[@frenchCorporationMoralPerson1979].
When thinking about a company, then it is their capability to make decisions that leads to that intentionality.
A organization needs an identity to make these decisions.
And similarly to how we saw with Locke above, this is based on its own history but also by reference to a self-assigned organization type[@whettenAlbertWhettenRevisited2006].
For now, this is enough background and I want to look at the nature of open source contributions in some more detail.
