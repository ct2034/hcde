# How do Personal vs Company Identities affect Open Source Contributions?

Imagine that you are a maintainer of a not unimportant open source project.
Now, there are two pull requests.
One from an individual contributor and one from a person that you know works for a certain company.
You know that the individual contributor has worked on the code they are contribution in their free-time and you really like the quality of their pull request.
The other contribution is also of high quality.

So does it make a difference that one person is working for a company and the other is not?
Technically both of these are just persons contributing code.
But can you really un-see that one belongs to a company or do you maybe even attribute this contribution primarily to that company?
A recent survey by the Linux Foundation found that organizations contribute 7.7B USD annually to open source projects and that 86% of that is contributed in the form of labour by individuals [@boysel2024OpenSource2024].
I am interested in what role the identity associated with individuals and their companies play in contributions to open source projects.

To explore the topic, I want to first look at some background on open source software and also give an overview on the theory on identities, both on an individual and a collaborative level.
Then I look at the nature of individual contributions in OSS, their motivations, and the role of community and meritocracy.
Contrasting that I will explore how and why companies contribute to OSS and will then see how this compares to the individual and to the community aspect of OSS projects.
Comparing both of the previous section I then identify key challenges and tensions.
Using the previously introduced organizational identity theory I can give some resolutions to these tensions.
I then want to give some practical examples and strategies to handel these.
In the end I give a conclusion.
