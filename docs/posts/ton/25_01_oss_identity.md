# How do Personal vs Company Identities affect Open Source Contributions?

Imagine that you are a maintainer of a widely used open source project relied upon by developers worldwide.
Now, there are two pull requests.
One from an individual contributor and one from a person that you know works for a certain company.
You know that the individual contributor has worked on the code they are contributing in their free time and you really like the quality of their pull request.
The other contribution is also of high quality.
Would you treat these contributions differently?
Should you?

Does it make a difference whether one person is working for a company and the other is not?<!-- more -->
Technically both of these are just persons contributing code.
But can you truly ignore the fact that one contributor belongs to a company, or do you even attribute their contribution primarily to that company?
A recent survey by the Linux Foundation found that organizations contribute 7.7B USD annually to open source projects and that 86% of that is contributed in the form of labor by individuals[@boysel2024OpenSource2024].
I am interested in the role that individual and company identities play in open source contributions.

To explore the topic, I will first provide background on Open Source Software and an overview of identity theory at both individual and collaborative levels.
Then I look at the nature of individual contributions in OSS, their motivations, and the role of community and meritocracy.
In contrast, I will explore how and why companies contribute to OSS and compare this to individual and community contributions.
Comparing both of the previous section I then identify key challenges and tensions.
Using the previously introduced organizational identity theory, I will propose resolutions to these tensions.
I then want to give some practical examples and strategies to handel these.
In the end I give a conclusion.

## Context: Open Source Software, Identity Theory

Open source in its basic form means that the source code of a piece of software is available freely for anyone to analyze, modify or share.
In practice, there are different licenses that are published with the source code each with somewhat different rights and duties associated to them.
But this is not what I am interested in, today.
What makes open source so powerful is that this free access to source code allows for truly open collaboration.
Eric S. Raymond described this in two contrasting models of software development of the "Bazaar" and the "Cathedral".
Here the Bazaar refers to the way software is developed in open source projects: openly and collaboratively, with many contributors.
While the Cathedral model symbolizes classic software development: closed within commercial development projects by a few experts.
And he argues that the Bazaar model is more effective for creating robust and innovative software[@raymondCathedralBazaarMusings2001].

Before exploring OSS projects further, though, I want to introduce the tool for this exploration: _identity_.
Generally speaking, identity is the relation an entity has to itself[@noonanIdentity2022].
Locke made clear that is fundamentally consciousness what allows for _personal identity_.
This consciousness can be extended backwards to past actions or thoughts[@lockeEssayConcerningHuman1694,@gordon-rothLockePersonalIdentity2020].
While this is a fundamental building block for identity, it alone will not help explaining what I am interested in.

A more modern take is _social identity_.
It is "a personâ€™s sense of who they are based on their  group membership(s)"[@turnerSocialComparisonGroup1979].
Knowing this can give people a sense of belonging, purpose, self-worth, and crucially identity.
In practice these groups can be defined by anything from ethnicity, religion to professional affiliation or musical preference[@turnerSocialComparisonGroup1979,@SocialIdentityTheory2023].
This can also explain aspects of how individuals identities are based on them being employed by a company.
However, I have one last section on corporations in particular.

When companies refer to themselves, it is called _organizational identity_.
Firstly, organizations are more than a collection of individual identities.
French argues that organizations as a whole have morality.
Basically, because they have intentionality and responsibility[@frenchCorporationMoralPerson1979].
When thinking about a company, then it is their capability to make decisions that leads to that intentionality.
A organization needs an identity to make these decisions.
And similarly to how we saw with Locke above, this is based on its own history but also by reference to a self-assigned organization type[@whettenAlbertWhettenRevisited2006].
I think, this is very interesting and can be used to explain many phenomena perceived when working in companies.
But for now, this is enough background and next I want to look at the nature of open source contributions in some more detail.

## Individual Contributions in OSS

Why do individuals contribute to open source?
I think, the core motivations are intrinsic.
The inherent passion for programming and development is not to be underestimated.
But, these OSS projects are also communities, and being involved in that can be very motivational.
And as we learned from social identity, belonging to a group is even fundamental to ones own identity[@SocialIdentityTheory2023].

Further, also extrinsic motivations play a role.
This includes ones own career advancement, because contribution to open source makes the individual visible and can create a reputation that may be useful when looking for a job.
And external recognition can also serve as a more general motivating factor.

To summarize with a quote, people contribute to OSS for reasons,

> both extrinsic, enhancing reputation and developing human capital and social networks; and intrinsic, satisfying psychological needs, pleasure, and a sense of social belonging[@benklerCommonsBasedStrategiesProblems2004].

Above I talked about recognition as one source of motivation.
But recognition does also serve a different purpose: power.
Open source projects are often described as meritocracies.
The terms was popularized by Young's dystopian book _The rise of the meritocracy_[@youngRiseMeritocracy1958].
In it, the envisioned future society based on meritocracy has many problems, for example a lack of social mobility.
But a careful analysis can disprove the negative effects of meritocracy which is now a fully positive ideal[@allenMichaelYoungsRise2011].

The idea is that power is awarded based on merit.
It is that merit that individual developers accumulate by contributing to open source projects.
With that, they will gain influence in the projects hierarchy.
This generally allows for more technically informed decisions, especially because this merit is fluid and can be gained and lost.
