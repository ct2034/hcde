# On Creativity in Software Engineering and the Role of Generative AI

If one were to ask people on the street to name creative jobs, I would not expect engineering or specifically software development to mentioned very often.
In this article I want to explore, if software engineering is creative.
But this is not only a question of categorization.
I want to use it to get a deeper understanding what SWE is, and am also interested in exploring the effect of GenAI on this discipline through that perspective.
