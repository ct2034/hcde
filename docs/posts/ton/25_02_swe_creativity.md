# On Creativity in Software Engineering and the Role of Generative AI

If one were to ask people on the street to name creative jobs, I would not expect software development to be mentioned very often.
On the other hand, there are many tasks and activities in the daily work of a software developer that seem very creative to me.
I would also describe myself as creative and developing software can be an outlet for this creativity.

In this article I want to explore, if software engineering is creative.
But this is not only a question of categorization.
I want to use this exploration to get a deeper understanding what creativity is.
This way, I also want to explore the effect of GenAI on the work of software engineers.

## What is creativity?

So, being creative means coming up with something new that is effective towards a goal.
