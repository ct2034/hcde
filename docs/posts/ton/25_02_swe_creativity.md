# On Creativity in Software Engineering and the Role of Generative AI

If one were to ask people on the street to name creative jobs, I would not expect software development to be mentioned very often.
On the other hand, there are many tasks and activities in the daily work of a software developer that seem very creative to me.
I would also describe myself as creative and developing software can be an outlet for this creativity.

In this article I want to explore, if software engineering is creative.
But this is not only a question of categorization.
I want to use this exploration to get a deeper understanding what creativity is.
This way, I also want to explore the effect of GenAI on the work of software engineers.

## What is creativity?

A very basic definition of creativity involves _originality_ and _effectiveness_[@runcoStandardDefinitionCreativity2012].
So, being creative means coming up with something new that is effective towards a goal.
For example a random process could come up with something original.
But this would then not be considered creative because it is not effective towards a given goal.
For me this definition makes creativity already more graspable, moving it away from a mysterious property that only artists have towards something that could be useful when developing software.

In psychology this a well-researched concept.
Researched often have the implicit or explicit goal of finding out how to improve peoples creativity in order to solve big problems of our world.
But before we look into that, the definition above feels still somewhat simplistic and also too coarse to cover everything from Leonardo Da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa to me making the logo for this blog.
Kaufman and Beghetto propose a model to differentiate these [@kaufmanBigLittleFour2009].
They would call one of these _Big-C_ creativity and the other one _little-c_.
And they also critique their field for focussing either on _Big-C_, when interviewing well-known creators considered top of their field or on _little-c_, when doing studies with students or children on the everyday creativity.
That's why they introduce two additional forms of creativity:
_Mini-c_, the "novel and personally meaningful interpretation of experiences, actions, and events"[@beghettoBroaderConceptionCreativity2007].
And _Pro-c_, which is the creativity of those that perform a task on a professional level.
This concludes their _Four C Model_.
For us, thinking about software engineering, this is very useful, because neither _Big-C_ nor _little-c_ seemed to fit what we are interested in.
I think, by definition the type of creativity that works for engineers must be _Pro-c_.
So, it is good to learn that the psychology research had a bucket for the creativity of us, engineers.
But, there is also research that explicitly looks at this.

## Creativity in Software Engineering

A qualitative study performed interviews with engineers aiming to clarify the role and extend of creativity in software engineering.
The participants agree "that being creative is a requirement to successfully tackle complex problems".
But they also state, that "‘Creativity is the means, not the goal.’" [@groeneveldExploringRoleCreativity2021].
