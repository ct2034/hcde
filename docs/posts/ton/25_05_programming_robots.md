# How does one program a robot? (working title)

A robot is characterized primarily by it's versatility.
It is a tool that can be used for a high variety of tasks in many different applications.
This makes it inherently hard to program a robot.
Especially, if the resulting robotic system is expected to act autonomously and robustly to unforeseen situations.

In well-established applications of robots in industrial automation the act of programming usually means the definition of a fixed sequence of motions that the robotic arm then executes time and time again.
When we instead think of a robot acting in a less structured environment like a home, the robot can not blindly follow a predefined sequence of actions.
Because, following these predefined actions will fail as soon as anything in that home changes.
And as everyone living with children knows, changes must always be expected but can never be predicted.

In this article I want to develop a better understanding of what it means to program a robot to act autonomously.
An with that it will be easier to see what may be missing in order to build genuinely autonomous machines.

Like with many questions, AI is something that comes to mind.
But at least for now, I am still assuming a human that builds and programs this robot.
Nevertheless, fixing the problems I develop here, will also be of use in programming approaches based on AI.
