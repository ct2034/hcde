# How does one program a robot? (working title)

A robot is characterized primarily by it's versatility.
It is a tool that can be used for different tasks in many context that each have there own special challenges.
This makes it inherently hard to program a robot.
Especially, if the resulting robotic system is expected to act autonomously and robustly to unforeseen situations.

In well-established applications of robots in industrial automation the act of programming usually means the definition of a fixed sequence of motions that the robotic arm then executes time and time again.
When we instead think of a robot acting in a less structured environment like a home, the robot can not blindly follow a predefined sequence of actions.
Because, following these predefined actions will fail as soon as anything in that home changes.
And as everyone living with children knows, changes must always be expected but can never be predicted.

In this article I want to develop a understanding of what it means to program a robot to act autonomously.
And I hope that with that understanding it will be easier to see what may be missing in order to build genuinely autonomous machines.

Like with many questions, AI is something that comes to mind.
But at least for now, I am assuming a human to be involved in building and programming this robot.
Nevertheless, fixing the problems I develop here, will help with AI-based approaches.
