street to name creative jobs, I would not expect software development to be mentioned very often.\nOn the other hand, there are many tasks and activities in the daily work of a software developer that seem very creative to me.\nI would also describe myself as creative and developing software can be an outlet for this creativity.</p>\n<p>In this article I want to explore if software engineering is creative.\nBut this is not only a question of categorization.\nI want to use this exploration to get a deeper understanding of what creativity is.\nAnd I also want to think about the effect of GenAI
