It is a method to build a directed roadmap graph that allows for collision avoidance in multi-robot navigation. This is a highly relevant problem, for example for industrial autonomous guided vehicles. The core idea of ODRM is, that a directed roadmap can encode inherent properties of the environment which are useful when agents have to avoid each other in that same environment. Like Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs), ODRM's first step is generating samples from C-space. In a second step ODRM optimizes vertex positions and edge directions by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This leads to emergent properties like edges parallel to walls and patterns similar to two-lane streets or roundabouts. Agents can then navigate on this graph by searching their path independently and solving occurring agent-agent collisions at run-time. Using the graphs generated by ODRM compared to an non-optimized graph significantly fewer agent-agent collisions happen. We evaluate our roadmap with both, centralized and decentralized planners. Our experiments show that with ODRM even a simple centralized planner can solve problems with high numbers of agents that other multi agent planners can not solve. Additionally, we use simulated robots with decentralized planners and online collision avoidance to show how agents are a lot faster on our roadmap than on standard grid maps.</p>"},{"location":"publications/20-03-30_optimized-directed-roadmap-graph-for-multi-agent-path-finding-using-stochastic-gradient-descent/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Paper</li> <li>Code</li> </ul>"},{"location":"publications/20-03-30_optimized-directed-roadmap-graph-for-multi-agent-path-finding-using-stochastic-gradient-descent/#presentation","title":"Presentation","text":""},{"location":"publications/20-03-30_optimized-directed-roadmap-graph-for-multi-agent-path-finding-using-stochastic-gradient-descent/#bibtex","title":"BibTeX","text":"<pre><code>@inproceedings{Henkel2020,\n    author = {Henkel, Christian and Toussaint, Marc},\n    title = {Optimized Directed Roadmap Graph for Multi-Agent Path Finding Using Stochastic Gradient Descent},\n    booktitle = {The 35th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC '20)},\n    address = {Brno, Czech Republic},\n    isbn = {978-1-4503-6866-7/20/03},\n    doi = {10.1145/3341105.3373916},\n    keywords = {Multi-agent planning,Multi-agent systems,Robotic autonomy},\n    year = {2020}\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"publications/20-06-22_ant-colony-optimization-based-multi-robot-planner-for-combined-task-allocation-and-path-finding/","title":"Ant colony optimization based multi-robot planner for combined task allocation and path finding","text":"<p>Agha Ali Haider Qizilbash, Christian Henkel, Sanaz Mostaghim @ UR 2020</p> <p>\ud83d\udd17 doi: 10.1109/UR49135.2020.9144944</p>"},{"location":"publications/24-10-01_gsrm-building-roadmaps-for-query-efficient-and-near-optimal-path-planning-using-a-reaction-diffusion-system/","title":"GSRM: Building Roadmaps for Query-Efficient and Near-Optimal Path Planning Using a Reaction Diffusion System","text":"<p>Christian Henkel, Marc Toussaint, Wolfgang H\u00f6nig @ IROS 2024</p> <p>\ud83d\udcc4 pdf \ud83d\udd17 doi: 10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10801293</p>"},{"location":"publications/24-10-01_gsrm-building-roadmaps-for-query-efficient-and-near-optimal-path-planning-using-a-reaction-diffusion-system/#abstract","title":"Abstract","text":"<p>Mobile robots frequently navigate on roadmaps, i.e., graphs where edges represent safe motions, in applications such as healthcare, hospitality, and warehouse automation. Often the environment is quasi-static, i.e., it is sufficient to construct a roadmap once and then use it for any future planning queries. Roadmaps are typically used with graph search algorithm to find feasible paths for the robots. Therefore, the roadmap should be well-connected, and graph searches should produce near-optimal solutions with short solution paths while simultaneously be computationally efficient to execute queries quickly. We propose a new method to construct roadmaps based on the Gray-Scott reaction diffusion system and Delaunay triangulation. Our approach, GSRM, produces roadmaps with evenly distributed vertices and edges that are well-connected even in environments with challenging narrow passages. Empirically, we compare to classical roadmaps generated by 8-connected grids, probabilistic roadmaps (PRM, SPARS2), and optimized roadmap graphs (ORM). Our results show that GSRM consistently produces superior roadmaps that are well-connected, have high query efficiency, and result in short solution paths.</p>"},{"location":"publications/24-10-01_gsrm-building-roadmaps-for-query-efficient-and-near-optimal-path-planning-using-a-reaction-diffusion-system/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Paper</li> <li>Code</li> </ul>"},{"location":"publications/24-10-01_gsrm-building-roadmaps-for-query-efficient-and-near-optimal-path-planning-using-a-reaction-diffusion-system/#presentation","title":"Presentation","text":""},{"location":"publications/24-10-01_gsrm-building-roadmaps-for-query-efficient-and-near-optimal-path-planning-using-a-reaction-diffusion-system/#bibtex","title":"BibTeX","text":"<pre><code>@misc{henkel2024gsrmbuildingroadmapsqueryefficient,\n      title={GSRM: Building Roadmaps for Query-Efficient and Near-Optimal Path Planning Using a Reaction Diffusion System},\n      author={Christian Henkel and Marc Toussaint and Wolfgang H\u00f6nig},\n      year={2024},\n      eprint={2410.11024},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.RO},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11024},\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"publications/24-11-08_towards-a-verifiable-toolchain-for-robotics/","title":"Towards a Verifiable Toolchain for Robotics","text":"<p>Charlie Street et al. @ AAAI Fall Symposium 2024</p> <p>\ud83d\udcc4 pdf \ud83d\udd17 doi: 10.1609/aaaiss.v4i1.31823</p>"},{"location":"publications/25-01-01_towards-robust-autonomous-robots-using-statistical-model-checking/","title":"Towards Robust Autonomous Robots Using Statistical Model Checking","text":"<p>Michaela Klauck, Ralph Lange, Christian Henkel, Selma Kchir &amp; Matteo Palmas @ ERF 2024</p> <p>\ud83d\udcc4 pdf \ud83d\udd17 doi: 10.1007/978-3-031-76424-0_25</p>"},{"location":"thinkoneering/24-12-20_how-to-write-a-blog/","title":"How to write a blog","text":"<p>My important thoughts</p> <p>moar</p>","tags":["test"]},{"location":"publications/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"thinkoneering/","title":"Thinkoneering","text":""},{"location":"cv/","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"page/2/","title":"Home - A space for my thoughts and projects","text":""},{"location":"publications/page/2/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"tags/","title":"Tag index","text":""},{"location":"tags/#first","title":"first","text":"<ul> <li>Energy Efficient Dynamic Window Approach for Local Path Planning in Mobile Service Robotics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tags/#test","title":"test","text":"<ul> <li>World domination company</li> <li>How to write a blog</li> </ul>"}]}
