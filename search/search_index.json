Often the environment is quasi-static, i.e., it is sufficient to construct a roadmap once and then use it for any future planning queries. Roadmaps are typically used with graph search algorithm to find feasible paths for the robots. Therefore, the roadmap should be well-connected, and graph searches should produce near-optimal solutions with short solution paths while simultaneously be computationally efficient to execute queries quickly. We propose a new method to construct roadmaps based on the Gray-Scott reaction diffusion system and Delaunay triangulation. Our approach, GSRM, produces roadmaps with evenly distributed vertices and edges that are well-connected even in environments with challenging narrow passages. Empirically, we compare to classical roadmaps generated by 8-connected grids, probabilistic roadmaps (PRM, SPARS2), and optimized roadmap graphs (ORM). Our results show that GSRM consistently produces superior roadmaps that are well-connected, have high query efficiency, and result in short solution paths.</p>"},{"location":"publications/24-10-01_gsrm-building-roadmaps-for-query-efficient-and-near-optimal-path-planning-using-a-reaction-diffusion-system/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Paper</li> <li>Code</li> </ul>"},{"location":"publications/24-10-01_gsrm-building-roadmaps-for-query-efficient-and-near-optimal-path-planning-using-a-reaction-diffusion-system/#bibtex","title":"BibTeX","text":"<pre><code>@misc{henkel2024gsrmbuildingroadmapsqueryefficient,\n      title={GSRM: Building Roadmaps for Query-Efficient and Near-Optimal Path Planning Using a Reaction Diffusion System},\n      author={Christian Henkel and Marc Toussaint and Wolfgang H\u00f6nig},\n      year={2024},\n      eprint={2410.11024},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.RO},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11024},\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"thinkoneering/24-12-20_how-to-write-a-blog/","title":"How to write a blog","text":"<p>My important thoughts</p> <p>moar</p>","tags":["test"]},{"location":"thinkoneering/","title":"Thinkoneering","text":""},{"location":"publications/","title":"Publications","text":""},{"location":"cv/","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"tags/","title":"Tag index","text":""},{"location":"tags/#test","title":"test","text":"<ul> <li>World domination company</li> <li>How to write a blog</li> </ul>"}]}
